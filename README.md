# Introduction to Deep Learning TUM
This is a course Introduction to Deep Learning from TU Munich. Including exercises and some personal notes.
1. If you have no experience with python, it will be a little hard to finish these exercises. But don't worry, there are some links that may help you (in Chinese).
2. You'd better have a genneral impression on the "Neural Network" from other places (for example YouTube :) ), that's can be very helpful to learn. Becasue although the name is "Introduction", it's still professional for who is compeletely zero-based.
3. Most of the Links here will be in Chinese, but the content I wrote will be in English. :D
